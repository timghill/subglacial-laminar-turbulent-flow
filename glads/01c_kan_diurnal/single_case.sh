#  Here:
#  $ID contains the case id from the original table (can be used to provide a unique seed to the code etc)
#  $COMM is the line corresponding to the case $ID in the original table, without the ID field
#  $METAJOB_ID is the jobid for the current meta-job (convenient for creating per-job files)

# Exit status of the code:

# Saving all current metajob statuses to a single file with a unique name:
