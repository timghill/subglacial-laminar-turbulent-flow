# Analysis of GlaDS outputs

The intended structure here is:

 * The `plot_*.py` modules contain functions to plot quantities of interest
 * The `make_*.py` scripts call the appropriate `plot_*` functions to make figures
 * Figures are saved in the `figures/` directory to keep things tidy
 * `defaults.py` contains some default settings and for figures
 * `helpers.py` helps with plotting channel networks
